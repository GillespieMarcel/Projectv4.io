	<h4>1/22/2020</h4>
		<p>Today was a good day. As per the usual, i woke up a a brisk 4:22 AM. no later, no earlier. Then i began my morning routine; sit down and stare at the large cow painting for 67 minutes, made some coffee and got dressed.
	where things got crazy was when i began my satanic ritul.

		Thats not true in the slightest. and if you belived that your a silly goose. a real silly goose. a goose that expands its wings so far and wide it then walks through a door. and that door is closed.
		did you want to wake up and be a goose? i didn't think so.
		<br>
		<br>
		What actually happend was i woke up and went to work. and thats it. It was a long day.
