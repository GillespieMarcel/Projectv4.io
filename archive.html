			<p>Personally, I'm pretty excited for Half-Life: Alyx and what it could potentially bring to VR and the future of video games. Each Half-Life (outside of the episodes and expansions)
			has fundamentally raised the bar for first-person shooters. 
			I always assumed if there was going to be a new Half-Life -- it would be for VR. I just don't see where else they could go within that genre that already hasn't been done better by now.
