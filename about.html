		Assignment: Project V1: Basic HTML and CSS<br>
		Date: 1/28/2020<br>
		The Site is currently barebone im sure there are a few things i could do better but since this
		isn't the final version i have more time to think about future additions.
		if you press F12 then you can see the source code, but all it really is; a navagation bar at the top
		a Title of what page you are on. Since the home page is what somone will see when they first come to,
		i gave a few short summaries on whatever the title of the book was, then followed by a link to continue
		reading that spacific review. further down is a similar function but instead of "reviews" its a
		blog, to make the page look less boring. after that is the footer with contact information.

		i Procratinated. i did everything on the last 2  days so i;m dure im missing somethings.
		i might restart everything as a re-organization thing.
		i added some of the requiements for the assignment like the rounded
		edge for the picture and the image maps. small things like that. i can see where it's useful buut. maybe not for this particular site.
